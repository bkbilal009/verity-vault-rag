**"Grounded document intelligence with zero hallucinations."**

## 🌟 Introduction (What is VerityVault?)
**VerityVault AI** is a sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application designed for users who need absolute factual accuracy. In an era where AI often "hallucinates" (makes up facts), VerityVault acts as a **Strict Librarian**. It locks the AI's knowledge to *only* the documents you provide, ensuring every answer is backed by your own data.

## 🚀 How It Works 

VerityVault doesn't just read your file; it understands the structure through a multi-stage pipeline:

1.  **Ingestion:** The system loads PDF or TXT files using specialized loaders.
2.  **Chunking:** Large documents are broken into 800-character "intelligent chunks" to maintain context.
3.  **Embedding:** Each chunk is converted into a high-dimensional vector using the `BGE-Small-En` model.
4.  **Vector Vault:** These vectors are stored in a **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) database for lightning-fast retrieval.
5.  **Strict Retrieval:** When you ask a question, the system finds the top 3 most relevant chunks and feeds them to the LLM.
6.  **Grounded Generation:** The **Llama 3.3** model (via Groq) generates a professional response *only* using those chunks.

## 🛠️ How It Was Built 

This project was engineered using the latest 2026 AI standards:

* **Brain (LLM):** `Meta Llama-3.3-70b-versatile` via **Groq Cloud** for sub-second inference speeds.
* **Orchestration:** **LangChain** (Classic & Community) for managing the RAG pipeline.
* **Vector Database:** **FAISS-CPU** for efficient local similarity searching.
* **Embeddings:** `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` – a state-of-the-art embedding model from Hugging Face.
* **Frontend:** **Gradio** – designed with a premium "Glassmorphism" theme and responsive UI.
